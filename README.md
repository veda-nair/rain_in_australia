## Rain prediction in Australia using logistic regression


## About the dataset:

This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia.
RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict. It means -- did it rain the next day, Yes or No? This column is Yes if the rain for that day was 1mm or more.

## About the project:

In this project, we will try to answer the question that whether or not it will rain tomorrow in Australia. We implement Logistic Regression with Python and Scikit-Learn.

To answer the question, we build a classifier to predict whether or not it will rain tomorrow in Australia. We train a binary classification model using Logistic Regression. I have used the Rain in Australia dataset for this project.
